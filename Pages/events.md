##Events

iPOP-UP organises several types of events
- *iPOP-UP bioinformatic meetings* : Online meetings held on zoom where someone presents a method or bioinformatic tools to others in a relaxed way. We value immensly community chimming in in these meetings. If you are interested in giving one, please contact [Alix Silvert](mailto:alix.silvert@u-paris.fr)
- *Bioinformatic workshops (incomming)* : In which a member of iPOP-UP gives a small introductory workshop to a limited number of people. We are still working on those, they will be announced as soon as they are ready.
