TODO : add iPOP-UP and Université de Paris logos

## Welcome to the iPOP-Up website
iPOP-UP is a platform at the Univesité de Paris aiming at helping researchers in their bioinformatics endeavours, that being with direct help, community building, or by sharing tools, here you will find bioinformatics ressources, tips and a list of our future events.

Note : This website is still under construction. Thank you for your patience


## Events
iPOP-UP organises several types of events
- *iPOP-UP bioinformatic meetings* : Online meetings held on zoom where someone presents a method or bioinformatic tools to others in a relaxed way. We value immensly community chimming in in these meetings. If you are interested in giving one, please contact Alix Silvert (TODO : add mail-to link)
- *Bioinformatic workshops (incomming)* : In which a member of iPOP-UP gives a small introductory workshop to a limited number of people.

Resume and documents related to past events can be dound here (TODO create corresponding links)

## Computing cluster
iPOP-UP has a computing cluster dedicated to bioinformatic analyses, hosted by the RPBS team. It is currently in closed beta, but will soon be open to reasearchers.

More information on the state of the cluster, how to access it and formations related to it can be found here (TODO)


## Bioinformatics tools
iPOP-UP is helping scientists refine and publish their tools. We are still working on our first projects, we will show them when they are ready !

## Direct bioinformatic help
iPOP-UP also provides direct bioinformatic help on specific project, by having a bioinformatician come and help mostly on the managing side of the project (i.e. tool selection, identification of problems with the current strategy and propose solution to them) and occasional help on bioinformatic scripts.

Our latest call for project is currently closed, however you can find the text [here](./Media/call_for_projects_2021.pdf) (TODO check that the link works)
